# Tiny Tapeout 10 Template Project

TinyTapeout is an educational project that makes it easier and cheaper
than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

Wokwi provides an easy way to create digital designs for Tiny Tapeout. 
You create a design out of individual logic gates, and simulate them 
with Wokwi to observe the result.

When your design is ready, you can submit it for manufacturing on a 
physical chip with Tiny Tapeout.
